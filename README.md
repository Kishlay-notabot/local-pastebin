# local-pastebin
a basic platform independent tool i developed for myself to share links from my phone to my pc and vice versa, without the hassle of sending it to myself on whatsapp etc. using flask and a bit of flask-sqlalchemy
# How to get it to work
I hosted this app on pythonanywhere, and then provided the api route in the html file, I've stored the html file locally on my desktop and android device, and i can access them by either pinning them to the browser or clicking on the shortcut on my android homepage. So I haven't hosted the frontend on the surface web, but just the api with obscure and randomized route, so that no one can access it.. only if they are very good guessers. 
# Issues
The copy button doesn't work on android, but i can just copy by selecting the text.
